    "Data cleansing is a subprocess of the data science process that focuses on removing errors in your data, so your data becomes a true and consistent representation of the processes it originates from. The entire process of cleaning, transforming and combining data is often said to represent 80% of data science projects.\n",

    "I will be demonstrating the most basic and common task in this minor project. More advanced features will not be explained in this project, such as:\n",
    "* detecting and handling outliers, \n",
    "* in-depth solutions for missing data (like multiple imputations) \n",

    "While waiting for [Star Wars: The Force Awakens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens) to come out, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: **does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?**\n",

    "The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which you can explore for yourself from [their GitHub repository.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey)\n",
