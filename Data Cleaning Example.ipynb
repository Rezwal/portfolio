    "\n",
    "While waiting for [Star Wars: The Force Awakens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Force_Awakens) to come out, the team at [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: **does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses, which you can explore for yourself from [their GitHub repository.](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will provide an example of cleaning and slightly analyzing the data on the Star Wars movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Importing the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the `Pandas` library as the main tool for getting familiarized and tidying the data. Fortunately, the Pandas library also provides excellent data importing options with various essential paramters (e.g. the type of encoding). The following code will read the data from a __*\"Comma-separated values\"*__ (CSV) file into a pandas dataframe:"

    "\n",
    "As we now have all the data in the `star_wars` dataframe, lets begin to explore the data by first getting an overview of the column names, and also the number of columns and rows. We will obtain this information by using the `info` function in the Pandas library.\n",
